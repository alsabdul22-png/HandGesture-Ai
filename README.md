✋ Hand Gesture Recognition

📌 Overview

Hand Gesture Recognition is a real-time AI-based system that detects and analyzes hand movements using computer vision.
The project is built with Python for the backend processing and JavaScript (Node.js) for running and managing the application.

The system uses the device camera to track hand landmarks and recognize predefined gestures, then triggers specific actions based on the detected movement.

⸻

🛠️ Technologies Used
 • Python
 • JavaScript (Node.js)
 • OpenCV
 • MediaPipe (or hand tracking library)
 • Computer Vision techniques

⸻

⚙️ How It Works
 1. The camera captures live video input.
 2. The system detects hand landmarks using computer vision.
 3. Gesture patterns are analyzed.
 4. When a predefined gesture is detected, an action is triggered.
